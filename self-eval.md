# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It felt really good. Obviously, it's nice to do things right on the first try, but the information is less likely to stay with you when you don't have to work through it or overcome obstacles, and it's more satisfying to feel like you did it yourself as opposed to having the answers given to you.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Workflow has been great. I've been pleasantly surprised with my ability to stay on task and avoid distractions. I think taking breaks is going to become even more essential in Mod 1 when the workload becomes a lot larger, but for now it hasn't been difficult to add them in. I feel confident in my plan to take on the challenges and time-intensity of Mod 1, and now I just need to stick to it and/or adapt it as needed.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Other than "don't use puts statements inside of a method", I want to remember two things. First, this stuff takes a lot of time and practice to sink in, but it will get there, so be patient. Cloning and pushing back to GitHub was confusing at first, and now it's a lot less intimidating since I've done it so many times. Second, learning coding concepts doesn't have to be a dry (or boring) process. It's a lot more fun to code about dragons and hobbits, so be creative and have a good time with it wherever possible.
